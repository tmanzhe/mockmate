MockMate is an AI-powered application designed to enhance interview preparation by providing users with real-time feedback and an immersive, interactive experience. Through voice recognition and AI, MockMate simulates a live interview, where users respond to tailored questions based on their chosen topic. Once the interview concludes, users can switch to the "perspective mode," where they can view the interviewer's real-time thoughts on their performance. This unique feature allows users to gain insights into their strengths and areas for improvement from a different perspective, helping them understand how they come across and what they can adjust.
